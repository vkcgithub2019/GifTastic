# GifTastic

In this assignment, we just have to explain every line of codes for this Giftastic homework. This homework is about getting giphys from giphy.com, where we get the api key. The giphys are still when first loaded and the user can toggle between still and animate by clicking on the animal images. The user can also get new giphys by inputting the animal in the placeholder / box and then hit submit. Only 10 giphys are loaded at a time. To get giphys we first have to sign up for it at the giphy.com site.  The codes were sourced out to us by the instructor. We have to do this on the HTML, CSS, and Javascript file. In addition, I commented the usefulness of reset.css and in particular, meyerweb reset.
